  Okay a lot of boiler plate:

title, authors, abstract, motivation (??), theory with plots esp.
h-dimless and g(n,e) and sqrt(g(n,e))/n , CalTech exop database,  figure
explaining the pl_XXX and st_XXX, maybe, or labeled like theory formula for
h(f), exop histograms, LISA noise curve S_n(f), integration time,
results of individ modes (instantaneous modes) on noise vs freq, SNR table??,
SNR formula, proposed work, and references.

 I like the 4' wide by 3' high posters I have seen in the hall.  Also Fedex/
Kinkos will not do larger.  Do other people to larger.  APS board is 44"x91":)

 LibreOffice presentation for poster

./pix for figures and background images

Worry later about this.  Can always change the master.

Make your figures large, if poster is 48x36" , then assume bigger than 11x8.5,
so maybe 16x10 ?  Try it.

Font??

Need a large vanderbilt Icon too!

Like the three columns approach with "boxes" of 15" width.

Keep text minimal!

Should I repeat the Abstract?  Summarize?  other?

PrettyPrints has decent looking rcParams right now.  Poster layour rough.
Three cols a bad idea?
