  Okay a lot of boiler plate:

title, authors, abstract, motivation (??), theory with plots esp.
h-dimless and g(n,e) and sqrt(g(n,e))/n , CalTech exop database,  figure
explaining the pl_XXX and st_XXX, maybe, or labeled like theory formula for
h(f), exop histograms, LISA noise curve S_n(f), integration time,
results of individ modes (instantaneous modes) on noise vs freq, SNR table??,
SNR formula, proposed work, and references.
