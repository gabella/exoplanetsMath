# exoplanets
Some of the Mathematica files used in the calculation of gravitational waves from exoplanets.
Started GitHub repo on 20171010, by gabella.

Reorganized a very deranged and flat project.  The part I am sharing is the
Mathematica notebooks and maybe some python, to grab the Exoplanets database
at CalTech and to calculate the gravitational wave strength from those
planets.

My top directory is ~/Documents/astro/exop/  and contains
docs/
  The PDFs for relevant papers, especially on eccentricity distributions of
  the exoplanets.
exoplanetsMath/
  The folder of Mathematica notebooks, *.dat and *.csv files, etc.
notes/
  Presentations summarizing the work, or other personal notes, not published
  work.

In exoplanetsMath/  , this GitHub repository,
arch/
  Archives, usually old not useful documents that I am too afraid to delete, or
  I am unsure of their utility.
dbases/
  The "databases" for this project, mostly the exoplanets csv files.
pix/
  The generated images and pictures.  Also likely xmgrace files and *.dat
  that they use for formatting for a publication.
python/
  I like python and ipython notebooks, so if I have any useful ones they are here.
